level7:
1 "You land on your feet but cannot see anything. Slowly the fog of war clears,\n" +
                "you are standing in the pit of a rocky chasm. The sky above is an iridescent\n" +
                "purple with lines of black almost tearing up the sky. You are in some kind of anomaly unlike \n" +
                "anything you have ever experienced.\n\nTo your left you see a path stretching up the chasm leading to higher ground\n" +
                "It is unclear what lies straight ahead as the path is shrouded by a cloud of dust and debris.\n\n"

level7_1:
1 "You follow the left path, rising steadily until you're about 100 meters above the chasm’s depths.\n" +
                "The ground beneath you narrows, forcing cautious steps. Pressing forward, you reach a rope bridge,\n" +
                "its worn strands shifting in the breeze. Glancing back, you spot the leftmost edge of the wall—rough,\n" +
                "but climbable.\n\n"

2 "1. Climb the rocky wall.\n2. Step onto the rope bridge."

3 "1. Scramble upward, pushing your limits as the demon closes in.\n2. Lash out with a desperate kick, aiming straight for its stupid face."

4 "You press on, scaling the rugged wall with steady determination.\n" +
                            "Before you know it, your hand finds the final ledge, and you pull yourself up."

level7_2:
1 "The wind howls as you push forward. As the dust settles, a marble staircase comes into view—pristine, out of place.\n" +
                "Descending, a familiar scent of cigar smoke fills the air.\n" +
                "remnants of excess. Greed awaits.\n\n"

2 "1. Descend the marble stairs (Back to greed)\n" +
                "2. Turn back and take the path upward, away from the excess below."

level7_3:
1 "You step onto the rope bridge, its frayed strands swaying beneath your weight.\n" +
                "The abyss yawns below, but hesitation won’t serve you now.\nfortune favors the bold."

2 "You make it across the rope bridge, steadying yourself on solid ground. Turning back,\nyou peer into the abyss" +
                    "100 meters of sheer drop. The realization settles in.\n" +
                    "If that rope had snapped, the fall would have been fatal. "

3 "A sharp snap rings out behind you. The world tilts—you fall.\n" +
                    "By sheer luck, your hands grasp the rope, stopping your descent.\n" +
                    "The impact against the chasm wall leaves you breathless, but you’re still hanging on.\n"

4 "You attempt to pull yourself up.. lets just hope you are strong enough\n\nPress ENTER to climb"

5 "You pull yourself up the rope, muscles straining but growing stronger.\nEvery challenge,every fight—it’s all paying off.\n" +
                        "Bit by bit, you’re becoming tougher for what lies ahead."

6 "Your grip weakens, arms burning. The rope sways—you're running out of time."

7 "Your grip fails. The world tilts as you fall, vertigo consuming you. The abyss rushes up—there’s no stopping it now."

level7_4:

1 "The wind howls through the chasm, its breath sharp with the scent of ruin.\n" +
                      "Below, cracked plains stretch into infinity, bones scattered like whispers of past agony.\n" +
                      "The sky, bruised and relentless, presses down, mirroring the hunger within.\n" +
                      "On the horizon, a solitary tower rises—blackened, defiant.\n" +
                      "It calls to you, its whisper threading through the ruinous winds,\n" +
                      "beckoning you forward into the unknown.\n\n"

2 "1. Head Towards the Tower"

3 "The wind howls, pushing against you, each step heavier than the last.\n\n" +
                       "Your strength fades, the tower distant, unwavering.\n You spot a nearby bonfire"

4 "The cracked plains stretch endlessly, each step grinding against fragments of ruin.\n Wind, sharp with whispers of past agony, drives you forward.\n" +
                "The Carnal Tower looms ahead, its marble spine fractured, clawing at the heavens. \nThe spiral staircase winds upward—worn, broken, defiant.\n" +
                "At its base stands the gate keeper. His armor, a shiny fusion of metal and sin, exudes an aura of ruin.\n Darkness stares from within his helmet, a silent challenge.\n\n"

5 "'Mortal, Your journey was long, but futile. This is King Minos' domain and you are unworthy of his gaze. \n" +
                "Turn back, lest this place strip you bare. There is no salvation here. Only judgment.'\n\n"
